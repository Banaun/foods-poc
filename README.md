# Foods-PoC

This project came to life when I had my intership at HiQ Malm√∂.
The project consists of two parts:

- backend with Java Spring
- frontend with ReactJs and TailwindCSS

# Instructions

- backend
  - In your favorite IDE, open pom.xml (located in ../backend/FoodsPOC) and run FoodsPocApplication.java.
- frontend
  - In the project directory (../frontend/foods-poc), run `npm install` to install project dependencies, then run `npm start` to run the application on localhost.
